Feature: Keyserver interaction with GnuPG
  As a Tails user
  when I interact with keyservers using various GnuPG tools
  the configured keyserver must be used
  and all Internet traffic should flow only through Tor.

  Background:
    Given I have started Tails from DVD and logged in and the network is connected
    And the "DF841752B55CD97FDA4879B29E5B04F430F80A2C" OpenPGP key is not in the live user's public keyring
    And GnuPG is configured to use a non-Onion keyserver
    And Seahorse is configured to use Chutney's onion keyserver

  Scenario: Fetching OpenPGP keys using GnuPG should work and be done over Tor
    When I fetch the "DF841752B55CD97FDA4879B29E5B04F430F80A2C" OpenPGP key using the GnuPG CLI
    And the GnuPG fetch is successful
    Then the "DF841752B55CD97FDA4879B29E5B04F430F80A2C" key is in the live user's public keyring
    And GnuPG's dirmngr uses the configured keyserver

  Scenario: Fetching OpenPGP keys using Seahorse should work and be done over Tor
    When I fetch the "30F80A2C" OpenPGP key using Seahorse
    And the Seahorse operation is successful
    Then the "DF841752B55CD97FDA4879B29E5B04F430F80A2C" key is in the live user's public keyring

  Scenario: Fetching OpenPGP keys using Seahorse via the OpenPGP Applet should work and be done over Tor
    When I fetch the "30F80A2C" OpenPGP key using Seahorse via the OpenPGP Applet
    And the Seahorse operation is successful
    Then the "DF841752B55CD97FDA4879B29E5B04F430F80A2C" key is in the live user's public keyring
