Hi,

the Tails {{version}} images will soon be available for download
and manual testing.

I'll let you know once they're available.

Once we'll reach that point there, you can download the images
from at least one of these places:

 - http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/stable/tails-amd64-{{version}}/
 - the Torrent (which I'll send you)
 - https://mirrors.wikimedia.org/tails/stable/tails-amd64-{{version}}/
 - https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/tails/stable/tails-amd64-{{version}}/

Here's the pad for testing coordination:

    {{pad}}

Please "tag" tests that you are doing so we don't duplicate work.

Please test by Tuesday, 14:00 UTC.

I expect feedback on the pad but if you have questions, I'll try to be on XMPP.

After the release, feel free to report to <tails-accounting@boum.org>
the time you spent on these tests: you can get paid for them.

Thanks a lot in advance,
cheers!
