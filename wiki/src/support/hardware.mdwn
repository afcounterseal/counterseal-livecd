Hi,

Thank you for sharing your experience with us. We are sorry that Tails does not
work well on this computer.

It is very difficult to investigate such problems without having access to the
affected computer. Furthermore, even if we managed to investigate the problem,
unfortunately we would lack resources to solve it.

If you did not do it yet, please read our Support page:
https://tails.boum.org/support/

We need more information from you in 2 cases:

- **If this problem did not happen with an older version of Tails**:

  Please tell us which older version worked better.

- **If you find a way to workaround the problem**:

  Please tell us, and we will document it so that other affected users benefit from your findings.

Our best hope is that a future Linux driver update will solve the
problem.

For advanced Linux users: if you want to dig deeper on your own, you can take it
upstream after reproducing on a recent, non-Tails Linux system.

Thanks for your understanding :)
