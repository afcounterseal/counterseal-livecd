Metaphor: Tails as a tent
=========================

From "[Writing good documentation](https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/426)" at the IFF 2018

- Amnesic
  - Empty every time its setup
  - Stored in backpack ("USB stick") along with "stuff" which can be
    moved into the tent ("persistence") or not.

- Incognito
  - Can move around (change "address")
  - Many tents look alike
  - Works best among other tents (not in a library)

- Portable
  - Can carry around in backpack
  - Can set up in backyard (own laptop) or away from home

- Put it away when its finished
