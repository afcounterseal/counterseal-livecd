Research questions
------------------

### Size of user base

- How many users do we really have?

  Right now we only have number of boots per day but combining this
  with how frequently people use Tails, we could extrapolate rough
  number of users and maybe usage categories (fraction of frequent
  users and occasional users, etc.).

### Technical skills

- How technically skilled are our users?
- How big is the difference between the technical skills of our target
  audience and real audience?
- Is there a match between how hard Tails is to use and the skills of
  our actual users?

### Region

- Is Tails useful and accessible by a global audience?

- Information on where Tails is used the most is very helpful for
  fundraising, outreach, or translation efforts.

### Current features

- What are people using Tails the most?

  This would help us clarify what are the most important features of
  Tails and prioritize incremental improvements.

### New features

- How shall we prioritize our future plans?

- What is missing the most in Tails?

  This would help us build a better roadmap.

### OpenPGP

- How many users use OpenPGP mostly to verify downloads?

- How many users use KeePassX to type their OpenPGP passphrase? ([[!tails_ticket 17867]])

### Upgrades

We used to have quantitative data on which versions our users were
running but we lost this in 4.2. ([[!tails_ticket 17545]])

In April 2019, 10 days after 3.13:

- 28.7% of users were using an outdated version
- 5.3% of users were using a version that was between 6 and 12 months old
- 4.1% of users were using a version that was more than 12 months old
- 1.6% of users were stuck with 3.5, which was 14 months old and the last forced manual upgrade

See the [detailed analysis](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/ux/-/raw/master/upgrades/april-2019.ods).

What user research could we do to complete this quantitative data?

What we already have:

- Qualitative info here and there about upgrades being painful

  - [[Roberto, October 2019|contribute/how/user_experience/interviews/roberto]]:

    > More than anything, they are upgrades constantly. Sometimes it takes us a
    > whole day to do an upgrade and then there's another one the week after. I
    > could do some parts of it but not everything.

    > Each time there's an upgrade we have to do a backup, I'm not sure if
    > that's for security or for technical reasons. GlobaLeaks also have expiring
    > GPG keys and we have to make sure that the GPG keys match or otherwise I
    > could loose files.

  - [[Joana and Orlando, January 2018|contribute/how/user_experience/interviews/joana_orlando]]:

    > Joana once had problems with upgrade on a USB stick. She could do the
    > first two upgrade but then it was not possible to do the third one.

  - [[Claudia and Felix, January 2018|contribute/how/user_experience/interviews/claudia_felix]]:

    > The first year Tails worked very well. But then they started
    > having more problems when the upgrades started.

    > Several time, their Tails stopped working because of an upgrade.
    > In such cases they would get help from another organization
    > collaborating with the whistleblowing platform which has more
    > technical staff. Right now for example, their Tails has been
    > broken since December and is being fixed by them.

    > One of their Tails was so old that it was impossible to upgrade
    > it. Felix installed a new Tails and copied the cryptographic key
    > to the whistleblowing platform manually.

  - [[Isabella, May 2017|contribute/how/user_experience/interviews/helen]]:

    > Upgrades are painful when using Tails not so often.

  - [[Ernesto, March 2017|contribute/how/user_experience/interviews/ernesto]]:

    > The fact the upgrade mechanism is sometimes automatic and sometimes
    > manual. You never know what to expect.

  - [[Helen, March 2017|contribute/how/user_experience/interviews/helen]]:

    > She likes the automatic upgrades in general but she always have to go
    > back to the documentation when the upgrade fails. As part of her work, she
    > also sometimes sees infrequent users struggling with accumulated upgrades
    > (for example upgrading from 2.6 to 2.10).

- Top 5 hot topic in [OpenPGP and Pidgin
  survey](https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/user_survey/openpgp_and_pidgin/#index3h2)

  - 5 comments were about simpler and easier upgrades without specifying
  - 4 comments were directly complaining about manual upgrades and asking for always going automatic upgrades
  - 2 comments were about faster upgrades
  - 1 comment was about less frequent upgrades

We could also research:

- What makes people skip or delay upgrades?

- Ask questions about upgrades in a survey and follow up with a few interviews
