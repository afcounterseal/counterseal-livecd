Checklist
=========

If you feel like it:

- Check [[reports written for sponsors|contribute/reports]]

Publishing
==========

- If you don't have the commit bit on our main repo. You can find the page of   the report in a list at the top of this page and edit the page of the report  clicking on the key in the top right corner. Notify <tails-project@boum.org> when you think that the report is ready for
  publication.
  
- If you have the commit bit on our main repo, you can do the
  publication:

  - Ensure the `meta date=` directive is set to today's date in RFC 2822 format
    (e.g. `date --rfc-2822`).
  - Move report to `news/report_YEAR_MO.mdwn`.
  - Commit.
  - Build the website locally and check that it builds fine and the
    report renders well (e.g. no broken links that worked earlier only
    because the report was under `blueprints/`).
  - Push.
  - Tweet about the report:
       - "In MONTH, we worked on [...] and more: https://tails.boum.org/news/report_YEAR_MO."
       - If you don't have access to our Twitter account send your text
         for the tweet along with your merge request for the report.
  - Email the [[simplified HTML version of the report|simplified]]:

          To: tails-project@boum.org
          Cc: tor-project@lists.torproject.org
          Subject: Tails report for XXXXXXXX YYYY
          Reply-to: tails-project@boum.org

    Do the following to compose an email in HTML in *Thunderbird*:

    1. Choose [[!img lib/open-menu.png alt="Menu" class=symbolic link="no"]]&nbsp;▸
       **Preferences**&nbsp;▸ **Accounts Settings**.

    2. In the **Composition & Addressing** tab of your email account,
       select **Compose messages in HTML format**.

    If your email client, like *Thunderbird* in Tails, doesn't allow you
    to send emails in HTML format, you can probably do so from the
    webmail application of your email provider.

  - Make sure that we already have a volunteer for next month, or
    otherwise raise the issue on <tails-project@boum.org> and update the
    [[list of volunteers|monthly_report#coordinators]].
