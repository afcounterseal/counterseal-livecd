# One possible plan

Goal: avoid the need to disable Secure Boot in the firmware
configuration. Tails should boot out-of-the-box with Secure Boot
enabled, without the user having to do _anything_ special about it.

Means: use the shim signed by Microsoft + GRUB2.

We don't support booting on a custom built kernel, so that should be
relatively easy. Except:

* The kernel won't allow loading an unsigned `aufs` module so we need
  to migrate to `overlayfs` ([[!tails_ticket 8415]]).
* `overlayfs` does not allow stacking enough layers for our current
  upgrade system, so we need to [[!tails_ticket 15281 desc="stack one
  single SquashFS diff when upgrading"]].

Resources
=========

* Debian's [[!debwiki SecureBoot desc="Secure Boot support"]] will be
  done for GRUB first, unclear if other bootloaders will be supported
  - tracker bug: [[!debbug 820036]]
  - shim is [[!debpts shim-signed desc="in Debian"]] (signed by the
    Microsoft UEFI CA) but grub2-signed is not ([[!debbug 820050 desc="RFP bug"]]).

  - [Ubuntu Privacy Remix](https://www.privacy-cd.org/)'s next release
    (UPR 12.04r1) will support UEFI; a beta is available; they copied
    the solution from Ubuntu 13.10 (beta): the shim bootloader and
    a corresponding GRUB binary which passes secure boot. See their
    [build script](https://www.privacy-cd.org/en/tutorials/build-your-own-cd/79).

Automated testing
=================

* The hard(est) part seems to be about how to enroll the signing keys
  into the nvram file.
   - [[!debpkg ovmf]] 0.0~20200229-2 installs a "ms" firmware
     descriptor, "which has keys pre-enrolled and Secure Boot enabled".
     E.g. in the package there's `/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_VARS.ms.fd`
     and `/usr/share/qemu/firmware/40-edk2-x86_64-secure-enrolled.json`.
     There's probably a way to ask libvirt to instruct QEMU to use that.
   - One option is to use `EnrollDefaultKeys.efi` from OVMF.
