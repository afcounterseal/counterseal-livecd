  <p class="big">To use Tails, shut down the computer and start on your Tails USB stick
  instead of starting on Windows, macOS, or Linux.</p>

  <p class="big">You can temporarily <strong>turn your own
  computer into a secure machine</strong>. You can also <strong>stay

  <p class="medium">Tails is a

  Tails works on most computers less than 10 years old.
  You can start again on the other operating system after you shut down
  Tails.</p>

  <p class="medium">You don't have to worry about the computer having viruses
  because Tails runs independently from the other operating system and never uses the hard disk.
  But, Tails cannot always protect you if you
  install it from a computer with viruses or if you use it on a computer
  with malicious hardware, like keyloggers.</p>

  <h2>Amnesia</h2>

  <p class="big">Tails always starts from the same clean state and <strong>everything you
  do disappears</strong> automatically when you shut down Tails.</p>

  <p class="medium">Without Tails, almost everything you do can leave traces on the
  computer:</p>

  <ul class="medium">
    <li>Websites that you visited, even in private mode</li>
    <li>Files that you opened, even if you deleted them</li>
    <li>Passwords, even if you use a password manager</li>
    <li>All the devices and Wi-Fi networks that you used</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="medium">On the contrary, Tails never writes anything to the hard
  disk and only runs from the memory of the computer. The memory is entirely
  deleted when you shutdown Tails, erasing all possible traces.</p>

P6: I don't understand this concept of "persistent encryption" (in Spanish)

P7: (after reading the description) I'm not sure what this means: is it a program? an online server? or saving stuff to the USB?
P8: (after reading the description) This is not clear to me. Persistence: I understand that it's a tool
    When prompted, understand the relationship between Amnesia and Persistence
P9: (only shown the title) Everything you do will be saved encrypted
    Persistence sounds to me like trying to encrypt over and over again
P10: (only shown the title) You need some kind of key to be able to use Tor and everything else
     Persistence is something that stays, a data that sticks with time
     (shown the description) It's an algorithm for encryption with which you can save some of your stuff
P12: (only shown the title) At first, thinks that everything is encrypted
     Persistence means "during a lot of time" or "very strong"
     Thinks that you can decide to encrypt the whole USB stick or not
     Sounds like a system of very strong passwords to make it even stronger to open your Tails
     Would call it "top security encryption"

  <h2>Tor for everything</h2>

  <p class="big">Everything you do on the Internet from Tails goes through the Tor
  network. Tor encrypts and anonymizes your connection by
  <strong>passing it through 3 relays</strong>. <i>Relays</i> are servers
  operated by different people and organizations around the world.</p>

  <p class="medium">A single relay never knows both where the encrypted
  connection is coming from and where it is going to:</p>

  <ul class="medium">
    <li>The 1st relay only knows where you are coming from but not where
    you are going to.</li>
    <li>This 3rd relay only knows where you are going to but not where
    you are coming from.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="medium">This way, Tor is <strong>secure by design</strong> even if a few
  relays are malicious.</p>

  <p class="medium">Tor has more than 6&#8239;000 relays. Organizations running Tor relays
  include universities like the MIT, activist groups like Riseup,
  nonprofits like Derechos Digitales, Internet hosting companies like
  Private Internet Access, etc. The huge diversity of people and
  organizations running Tor relays makes it more secure and more
  sustainable.</p>

  <h2>Avoid online surveillance and censorship</h2>

  <p class="big">Tor prevents someone watching your Internet connection from learning

  <p class="big">You can avoid
  censorship because it is <strong>impossible for a censor to know</strong> which
  websites you are visiting.</p>

  <p class="medium">If connecting to Tor is blocked or dangerous to use from where you
  are, for example Iran or China, you can use <i>bridges</i> to connect to
  Tor in a more discrete way. Different types of bridges work better in
