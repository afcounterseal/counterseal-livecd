<h1>Tails is a portable operating system that
protects your privacy and helps you avoid censorship.</h1>

</div>

</div>

<!--
P3: [DONE] Portable OS: something like iOS, Android? != mobile. Add "for laptops" somewhere
P4: [WONT] Does Tails sell the USB stick? Can I use any USB stick?
P5: [DONE] Is it like Ubuntu?
P9: [DONE] Didn't realize that Tails was an operating system

<!--
P10: Add mobile phone signal

P6: [DONE] At first, didn't see the guy walking away from the city
P11: [WORK] This is like Google
-->

<h3>Avoid surveillance, censorship, advertising, and viruses</h3>

<p>Tails uses the Tor network to protect your privacy online and help you avoid
censorship. Enjoy the Internet like it should be.</p>

<!--
P2: [DONE] No virus: "because it's Linux"
P4: [WONT: Cannot be solved] What does "No ads" mean? Will news websites start blocking me [ad-blockers]?
P5: [WONT: Explained in About] *No ads, no viruses* HOW? And is it because there's nothing important of the laptop, so there is no value for hackers?

<!--
P10: [WONT: Ended up understanding the tent metaphor] Would prefer a more robust place than a tent: a bunker!
P11: [WORK] Tails is like being alone and secure
-->

<h3>Your secure computer anywhere</h3>

<p>Shut down the computer and start on your Tails USB
stick instead of starting on Windows, macOS, or Linux. Tails leaves no trace on the computer when shut down.</p>

<!--
P1: [DONE] Install Tails on a USB stick and run it on any computer instead of STARTING ON Windows or macOS
P4: [WORK] AMAZING that I can use someone else's computer without compromising on security!
P5: [DONE] "Turn your own computer into a secure machine" [had to be read 3-4 times for understanding]. Is it like Vine?
P5: [DONE] "Instead of Win/mac" [had to be read twice, sentence structure] reads to them like Tails **only** works with Linux
P6: [DONE] Thinks that the image means that your computer can be safe even in a camping
P9: [DONE] Lo puedes usar en Windows o en Mac. No vi que funcione también para Linux.

<!--
P6: [DONE] Thinks that the telephone is tapped by the walkie-talkie
P8: [DONE] Thinks that the telephone is tapped by the walkie-talkie
P10: [WONT] Doesn't see much relation with the picture because displayed tools are not digital
P10: [WONT: Contradictory feedback] Camping kit transmits more independence and autonomy. La seguridad te la vas a proporcionar tu. Exploration kit son más cosas aisladas. Camping kit es más coecionada: funciono de esta manera
P11: [WORK] It's about hiking. You are hard to follow and find
P12: [WORK] Prefiere la primera porque son herramientas de comunicacion
P12: [WORK] The camping kit doesn't seem related so much to the topic
P12: [WONT: Contradictory feedback] Camping kit feels more like you are going to stay for a bit longer

<h3>Digital security toolbox</h3>

<p>Tails includes a selection of applications to work on sensitive documents and communicate
securely. Everything in Tails is ready-to-use and has safe defaults.</p>

<!--
P4: [DONE] *Toolbox* - can I access Google Docs? What are these tools?
P5: [DONE] *Toolbox* is this software written by Tails? Someone else? Who chose what to include, is it trustworthy?
P2: [DONE] "Which tools?"

<!--
P12: The price tag feels like it's a something pricee, also because of the lines

P6: [DONE] Thinks that the blueprint represents the act of coding.
P7: [DONE] Thinks that the blueprint represents non-recreational software.
P9: [DONE] Likes the heart better, made with love. Doesn't like always relating to money. Without heart is less cheesy.
P10: [WONT: Contradictory feedback] Prefers with price because it's the most obvious.
P10: [WORK] Gets the lace but wonders whether it's clear
P10: [DONE] Likes better with the heart than without because it carries more message of allowing people to escape the commercialization of data
P12: [DONE] Likes better the 1st one because it's not only about the price but also care and safety
-->

<h3>Free Software</h3>

<p>You can download Tails for free and independent security researchers can verify our
work. Tails is based on Debian GNU/Linux.</p>

<!--
P4: [DONE] The free software box is also slightly repetitive; maybe just add "free software" to the first sentence?
P5: [DONE] Who are independent researchers? Does it just mean everyone/all developers?
P9: [DONE] Unclear about who are the 'security researchers', los desarrolladores de Tails?
