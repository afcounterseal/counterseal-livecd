# Changes

Keeping an eye on the changes between released versions is one of the
many safeguards against releasing crap.

## Packages

Compare the list of bundled packages and versions with the one shipped last
time. `.packages` are usually attached to the email announcing the image is ready.

	/usr/bin/diff -u \
	    wiki/src/torrents/files/tails-amd64-3.1.packages \
	    tails-amd64-3.2.packages \
	    | wdiff --diff-input  --terminal

Check the output for:

- new packages that may cause harm or make the images unnecessarily
  big
- packages that could be erroneously removed
- new versions of software we might not have audited yet (including:
  does the combination of our configuration with software X version
  Y+1 achieve the same wished results as with software X version Y?)

## Image size

Check the images size has not changed much since the last release.

In a directory with many Tails ISO and USB images:

    find \( -iname "tails*.iso" -o -iname "tails*.img" \) \
	     -type f -exec ls -l --block-size=M '{}' \; | sort -rhk 5

# Reproducibility

This section can **not** be done by the RM.

0. Check that the <https://tails.boum.org/contribute/calendar/>
   documents who is the _Trusted Reproducer_ for this release.
   If this is not the case, ask the RM (this is the only exception
   to "do not trust anything said by the RM about this process").

1. Download the ISO and USB images.

2. Clear-sign the hashes of all products using your OpenPGP key
   and gzip the output (otherwise the signed text could be mangled
   at some point in the email chain):

        DEST_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
        sha512sum *.iso *.img \
          | gpg --clear-sign \
          | gzip \
          > "$DEST_DIR/TR-bits.gz"

3. Locate the file generated by the command above. To display its location,
   execute the following command:

        echo "$DEST_DIR/TR-bits.gz"

4. Send the aforementioned generated file as an attachment
   to the _Trusted Reproducer_.

5. If the _Trusted Reproducer_ is around, ask them:

    - if they've received your email
    - if they could successfully decompress the attachment
    - if they could check the inline signature of the attachment once decompressed
    - if the signed text contains all the information they need

# Automated test suite

See the [[automated test suite documentation|test/automated_tests]].

## Running the automated test suite

See [[test/setup]] and [[test/usage]].

Do point `--old-iso` to the ISO image of the previous stable release.

## Automated test suite migration progress

The manual test suite below either contains tests that cannot be
automated, has no automated test implemented yet, or has a test
implemented, but it either hasn't been reviewed, had a confirmed pass
by someone other than the test author, or has issues. The latter is
tracked by subtasks of [[!tails_ticket 10250]].

# Tor Browser

## Miscellaneous functionality

* Test if _uBlock_ works:
  - The _uBlock_ icon must be visible.
  - Visit a website that normally displays ads, such as
    <https://www.nytimes.com/>. The ads should not be displayed and
    the uBlock icon should display a strictly positive number of
    blocked elements.

## Security and fingerprinting

* [Download](https://torbrowser-archive.tails.boum.org/) the same version of Tor
  Browser and compare its fingerprint (running on Linux outside of Tails) with
  Tor Browser in Tails, using at least <https://panopticlick.eff.org/>.
  Click "Show full results for
  fingerprinting" to see the details we're interested in.
  - The exposed User-Agent should match the latest Tor Browser's one.
  - Ignore the result of the "blocking tracking ads" and "blocking
    invisible trackers" tests, which seem unreliable (we've seen
    different results for the very same version of Tor Browser).
  - Update the *Browser fingerprint* section of the
    [[known issues|support/known_issues]] if needed.
* In `about:config` check that `media.peerconnection.enabled` is set to
  `false`.

<a id="Thunderbird"></a>

# Thunderbird

## EHLO/HELO

Only perform this test if one of these conditions is met:

 - We're testing a release candidate, such as Tails 7.42~rc1.
 - The release under testing upgrades to a major Thunderbird version.
   For example, the last Tails release shipped Thunderbird 87.9, and the one
   you're testing includes Thunderbird 88.1.

To check that the EHLO/HELO SMTP message is not leaking anything
at the application level:

1. Start Thunderbird using the GNOME Applications menu.
2. Configure the outgoing SMTP server for an email account
   so it uses STARTTLS on port 587
   (Thunderbird will send two EHLO/HELO: one before TLS is
   initiated; one after; the assumption here is that Thunderbird will
   send the same both times).
3. Run `sudo tcpdump -n -i lo -w dump` while sending an email to
   capture the packets before Tor encrypts it, then close
   tcpdump. Note that the packet containing EHLO/HELO will be sent
   really early, so even if the email failed (e.g. because the mail
   server doesn't support plaintext SMTP on port 587) we are ok.
4. Check the dump for the HELO/EHLO message and
   verify that it only contains `127.0.0.1`:
   `sudo tcpdump -A -r dump | grep EHLO`

# WhisperBack

* I should be able to send a bug report with WhisperBack.
* When we receive this bug report on the tails-bugs mailing list,
  Schleuder tells us that it was sent encrypted.

# Virtualization support

* Test that Tails starts and the browser launches in VirtualBox.

# Incremental upgrades

(automate: [[!tails_ticket 18004]])

1. Install _from scratch_ on a USB stick the previous Tails stable release
   (that is, at this time, the current published one).
   A system that was upgraded to that version will not do.

2. Start from that USB stick.

3. Set an administration password in the Welcome Screen.

4. Upgrade to the version we're testing:

        sudo sh -c 'sed -i /^TAILS_CHANNEL=/d /etc/os-release &&
                    echo TAILS_CHANNEL=\"test\" >> /etc/os-release' && \
        systemctl --user restart tails-upgrade-frontend.service

5. Once the upgrade has been applied and you're suggested to restart Tails,
   do that.

6. Verify that the resulting, upgraded system "works fine":

   * it boots
   * it pretends to be the correct version
   * Tor works fine
   * Tor Browser works fine
   * the Unsafe Browser starts

# Tails Verification

* The goal is to check that *Tails Verification* works in *Tor
  Browser* in the version of Tails we are testing here. *Tails
  Verification* only supports verifying the current release so for
  example, when doing tests for the Tails 3.13 release, we use it in
  the tentative Tails 3.13 to verify the Tails 3.12 ISO and USB images.

  1. Start the Tails that you are testing.

  2. Start *Tor Browser*.

  3. Visit <https://tails.boum.org/install/download-iso/>.

  4. If you already have the ISO image for the last, already released
     version of Tails, i.e. the one that's advertised in the sidebar
     of our production website, then click "*I already downloaded Tails $N*".
     Otherwise follow the instructions on that web page to download
     the ISO image.

  5. Install *Tails Verification*.

  6. Click the **Verify Tails $N** button.

  7. The verification should be successful.

  8. Repeat for the USB image, except the URL for step (3) is:
     <https://tails.boum.org/install/download/>

# Torrents

Make sure that the .torrent files we advertise for this release can be
used to download the *full* images:

* ISO

* USB image

# Real (non-VM) hardware

`[can't-automate]`

Note that for release candidates, we do not always optimize the ordering
of files in the SquashFS, which might make them boot somewhat slower.

On a 64-bit computer that has Secure Boot enabled and that is configured to
prefer UEFI:

1. Freshly install the version of Tails being tested to a USB stick.
2. Boot this USB stick on bare-metal a first time to trigger re-partitioning.
   You should the "GNU GRUB" title, as opposed to a syslinux menu.
3. Boot this USB stick a second time, measuring the boot time (from the
   GRUB menu until the GNOME desktop is ready -- quickly press
   ENTER in the Welcome Screen).
4. Compare with the boot time of the previous Tails version. The new
   one should not be significantly slower to start.

On a computer configured to prefer legacy BIOS boot:

1. Freshly install the version of Tails being tested to a USB stick.
2. Boot this USB stick on bare-metal a first time to trigger re-partitioning.
   You should see the "SYSLINUX" title in the bootloader, as opposed to GRUB.
3. Boot this USB stick a second time.
4. You should see the Welcome Screen appear.

# Misc

* Check that the output of `sudo journalctl` should seem OK.
  For a quick overview, something like `sudo journalctl -p 0..3` can be helpful.
