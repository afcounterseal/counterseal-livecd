# Requesting sponsorship for a sprint

## Should each attendee request sponsorship separately?

No: send one single sponsorship request for the sprint, including shared
expenses (e.g. accommodation) and individual ones (e.g. travel tickets).

## What kind of costs are covered?

This sponsorship can cover your travel costs, food, hydration, and
local transportation.

When spending Tails' money, keep in mind that the project is working
with a limited budget that is to be used with frugality.

## Is it OK to request sponsorship after the fact?

No, it's not OK. In order to avoid biasing the decision-making process,
sponsorship should be asked before spending the corresponding money.

## What should we write in our sponsorship request?

Sponsorship requests must include:

 - the number of attendees

 - the location of the sprint

 - the estimated maximum budget for:
 
    - travel costs
    - accommodation
    - food
    - other expenses (like local transportation)

 - A list of objectives for the event; in other words, what do you plan
   to do there, and why will it be beneficial for Tails.

## Who should we write to?

Send your sponsorship request to the <tails@boum.org> private mailing
list: [[about/contact#tails]].

## How do we get actually reimbursed?

The process to get your expenses reimbursed is not documented yet,
stay tuned. Meanwhile:

 - While spending money on behalf of Tails, keep the original proofs
   (e.g. paper receipts) of all the expenses you want Tails
   to reimburse.

 - Reimbursements are processed by our accounting team:
