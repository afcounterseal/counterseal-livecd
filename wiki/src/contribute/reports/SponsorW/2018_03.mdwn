Everything in this report is public.

# A. VeraCrypt support in GNOME

## A.4 Add VeraCrypt support to udisks

We worked with upstream on the libblockdev and udisks changes (pull
requests [#320](https://github.com/storaged-project/libblockdev/pull/320)
and [#495](https://github.com/storaged-project/udisks/pull/495)). The
libblockdev pull request was successfully merged
([[!tails_ticket 15219]]).

## A.6 Add VeraCrypt support to GNOME Files

We worked on supporting VeraCrypt volumes in the unlock dialog opened by
gvfs-udisks2-volume-monitor, which allows unlocking encrypted volumes
via GNOME Files or when the storage device is plugged in
([[!tails_ticket 15218]]).

# B. Additional software

## B.2 Write technical design documentation

The draft has been
improved during development.

## B.3 Write automated tests

Almost all of the Gherkin scenarios written until now
([[!tails_ticket 14576]]) are running smoothly on our
Jenkins instance.

These tests already helped us identify and fix bugs in
the feature.

## B.4 Implement backend and GUI

The backend and the GUI components are implemented ([[!tails_ticket
14594]] and [[!tails_ticket 14595]]) and we started reviewing the code
internally ([[!tails_ticket 14598]]).
