[[!meta title="Accounting and management team"]]

The Accounting Team is responsible for a mix of accounting,
and management tasks:

- Accounting:
  - Keeping an accounting of the money held by our fiscal sponsors.
  - Tell workers when they can get paid for their work.
  - Process reimbursements of contributors' expenses.
  - Interface with our fiscal sponsors.

- Budgeting:
  - Build financial reports for both internal and public use.
  - Propose a budget each year to plan our expenses. This
    process also helps review the work of the different teams,
    adjust their mission, check the availability, needs, and desires of
    workers, etc.
  - Help <tails@boum.org> take decisions on how to spend our money. The
    Accounting Team is *not* the entity that decides how our money is
    spent and this is the responsability of a larger set of
    contributors, usually <tails@boum.org>, sometimes
    tails-summit@boum.org.

- Management:
  - Help teams recruit and onboard new members, especially regarding the
    organizational and financial aspects.
  - Build documentation to make this recruiting and onboarding easier.
  - Move forward project-wide discussions dealing with money and paid
    work like reimbursement, sponsorship, and compensation policies,
    etc.
  - Help teams resolve internal conflicts or project management issues
    that they cannot solve by themselves.
  - Identify overloaded teams and contributors and help solve problems
    regarding workload and calendar.
