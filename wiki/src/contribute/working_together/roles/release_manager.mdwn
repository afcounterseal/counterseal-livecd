# Tasks

## Continuously

Stay on top of email received on the Release Managers mailing list.
This includes for example analyzing failure notifications for Jenkins jobs
and filing tickets for the Foundations Team as needed.

## In the beginning of your shift

- Check the Mozilla release calendars:
  * [Google calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=mozilla.com_2d37383433353432352d3939%40resource.calendar.google.com)
  * [Release schedule](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Calendar)
- Reply to the email sent to <tails-dev@boum.org> and
  <tails-l10n@boum.org> by the RM for the previous release,
  to provide any information they could not, such as:
  - Code freeze date
  - If this will be a major release: the release schedule for its RC.
- Ask <tails@boum.org> and <tails-foundations@boum.org> for a _Trusted Reproducer_ who will reproduce the
  ISO and USB images for the RC and final release within 72 hours after
  the RM has unplugged their smartcard. When accepting the offer,
  the Trusted Reproducer must read the [["Preparation" section of
  the instructions|contribute/release_process/test/reproducibility#preparation]].
- Update [[contribute/calendar]] accordingly.
- Update the due date on [[!tails_roadmap]] accordingly.
- Make sure you have access to the various systems used to do
  the release:
  - being subscribed to the <tails-rm@boum.org> mailing list
  - having your OpenPGP signing subkey hardware and passphrase handy
  - commit access to the official [[contribute/Git]] repository
  - upload access to our [[custom APT repository|APT_repository/custom]]
  - having your GnuPG key in the list of uploaders for
    our [[custom APT repository|APT_repository/custom]]
  - <https://jenkins.tails.boum.org/>
  - SSH access to `rsync.lizard` and being a sudoer and in the `rsync_tails` group there
  - SSH access to `bittorrent.lizard` and being in the `debian-transmission` group there
  - SSH access to `reprepro-time-based-snapshots@apt.lizard`
  - look for `rsync|ssh` in [[APT_repository/custom]],
    [[APT_repository/time-based_snapshots]] and this very document
  - access to the RM team's Git repository: install the
    `git-remote-gcrypt` package, `git clone
    gcrypt::tails@git.tails.boum.org:rm`, follow instructions in the
    `README`
  - follow the instructions in `keyringer/README` in the RM team's Git
    repository then make sure you can `keyringer tails-rm decrypt credentials`
  - _Manager_ status on Redmine
- Check when our OpenPGP signing key expires.
  If that's before, or soon after, the scheduled date for the release
  _after_ the one your shift is about, then shout.
- The ISO images for *every* previous beta, RC, and final release
  based on the version of Debian that will be used for the release
  you'll be preparing.
  For example, if you're preparing 4.3, you need the ISO images
  for 4.0~beta1, 4.0~beta2, 4.0~rc1, 4.0, 4.1, 4.1.1, 4.2, and 4.2.1.

## Two weeks after the beginning of your shift

- Ensure you have found a _Trusted Reproducer_ and write who this is
  in the [[contribute/calendar]].
- Create a Foundations Team ticket about upgrading Tor Browser
  in the release your shift is about.
- Check if you have enough manual testers registered.
  If not, ping the usual testers.

## The week before the release date

If updating the Changelog is a particularly painful part of the
release process for you, then you can do it in smaller chunks,
starting ahead of the pre-release Monday.

The first time you run our `./release` script to seed the changelog
entry from Git commits:

1. Take note of which commit you're at.
2. Run it exactly as documented in the [[contribute/release_process]].

The next times you run our `./release` script:

1. Take note of which commit you're at.
2. Pass, as a second argument to `./release`, the commit you took note
   of last time you updated the Changelog.

XXX: fix `./release` so that there's a way to have it simply run `gbp
dch --auto`, which will avoid the need to take note of commits.

## The Friday before the release date

We need to coordinate our Tails release with the Tor Browser
developers to make sure that the Tor Browser we plan to include in our
release is ready in time for when we build the release image. The
Friday prior to the release seems like a good candidate, since it's
around this time they usually release tarballs for testing, and it
will still give some time for us to improvise according to their
"delayed" schedule and arrange a contingency plan (e.g. possibly
delaying our release a day or two). Asking for a status report a day
or two earlier than Friday *in addition* won't hurt, too.

<div class="note">

Note: the Tor Browser team Cc's tails-dev@boum.org when sending QA
requests to tor-qa@lists.torproject.org which makes this easier.
We are also often notified of any last last-minute rebuilds, better
ask explicitly the Tor Browser team what their plans are.

</div>

As soon as the new *Tor Browser* tarballs are ready, you may import
them in a topic branch and trigger CI runs, which will save you
some precious time on pre-release Monday. See the
[[Upgrading the Tor Browser|contribute/release_process/tor-browser]]
page for details.

## At least for the first release of the year

Have a look at scenarios or features added or modified since last time
this check was done, and check if the ones that depend on the
documentation have the `@doc` tag.

## Make the release happen

No kidding. See [[contribute/release_process]].

# Shifts

The release manager shifts could be done by a team. They start right after the
publication of the previous release to the publication and announcement of the
release they are taking care of.
