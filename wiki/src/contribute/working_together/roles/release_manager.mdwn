# Duties

The Tails Release Managers are primarily responsible for:

* publishing new Tails versions in a timely fashion, according to the
  schedule submitted by the [[Foundations Team|foundations team]];

* reaching a consensus regarding documenting, delaying, or releasing,
  when emergency releases might be warranted (usually prompted by
  unplanned Tor Browser releases for security issues that require
  urgent care);

* making sure automatic and manual testers are covered during each
  release process;

* being in the loop when major changes land in release branches, so
  that they can propose extra manual tests if those changes feel
  risky (e.g. changes in the upgrader code).

To ensure releasing is achievable in a timely manner, historically,
they have also been responsible for:

* making sure the various Git branches get successful builds and test
  suite runs in Jenkins, filing issues for the Foundations Team as
  needed.

This responsibility might get shifted to the Foundations Team in the
near future though.

Also historically, the Release Manager for a given Tails release deals
with integrating the target Tor Browser version, even if that's one of
the Foundations Team's duties.

# Shift

## In the beginning of your shift

- Check the [Tor Browser release
  schedule](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/wikis/Release-Schedule).
- Check the Mozilla release calendars:
  * [Google calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=mozilla.com_2d37383433353432352d3939%40resource.calendar.google.com)
  * [Release schedule](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Calendar)
- Reply to the email sent to <tails-dev@boum.org> and
  <tails-l10n@boum.org> by the RM for the previous release,
  to provide any information they could not, such as:
  - Code freeze date
  - If this will be a major release: the release schedule for its RC.
- Ask for a _Trusted Reproducer_:

        ./bin/generate-call-for-trusted-reproducer \
           --version VERSION_YOU_WILL_RELEASE

- Update [[contribute/calendar]] accordingly.
- Check if the due date of the corresponding
  [[!tails_gitlab groups/tails/-/milestones desc="GitLab milestone"]]
  is correct. If it is not, create a merge request against
  [[!tails_gitlab tails/gitlab-config]] to fix it.
- The ISO images for *every* previous beta, RC, and final release
  based on the version of Debian that will be used for the release
  you'll be preparing.

  To get the list of images you'll need, run:

        ./bin/iuk-source-versions VERSION_YOU_WILL_RELEASE

  For example, if you're preparing 4.4, you need the ISO images
  for 4.0~beta1, 4.0~beta2, 4.0~rc1, 4.0, 4.1, 4.1.1, 4.2, 4.2.2, and 4.3.

- Ensure the next steps are tracked in your preferred personal
  organization tool.

## Two weeks after the beginning of your shift

- Ensure you have found a _Trusted Reproducer_ and write who this is
  in the [[contribute/calendar]].
- Create an issue with the `Core Work: Foundations Team` label,
  about upgrading Tor Browser in the release your shift is about.
- Check if you have enough manual testers registered.
  If not, ping the usual testers.

## The Friday before the release date

Ask the Tor Browser developers when they expect they'll have
tarballs ready.

Rationale: we need to coordinate our Tails release with the Tor Browser
developers to make sure that the Tor Browser we plan to include in our
release is ready in time for when we build the release image. The
Friday prior to the release is a good candidate, since it's
around this time they usually release tarballs for testing, and it
will still give some time for us to improvise according to their
"delayed" schedule and arrange a contingency plan (e.g. possibly
delaying our release a day or two). Asking for a status report a day
or two earlier than Friday *in addition* won't hurt, too.

<div class="note">

Note: the Tor Browser team Cc's tails-dev@boum.org when sending QA
requests to tor-qa@lists.torproject.org which makes this easier.
We are also often notified of any last last-minute rebuilds, better
ask explicitly the Tor Browser team what their plans are.

</div>

As soon as the new *Tor Browser* tarballs are ready, you may import
them in a topic branch and trigger CI runs, which will save you
some precious time on pre-release Monday. See the
[[Upgrading the Tor Browser|contribute/release_process/tor-browser]]
page for details.

## Make the release happen

No kidding. See [[contribute/release_process]].
