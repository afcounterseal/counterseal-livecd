# 2020 Q1

* late 2020-03: Release 4.5~rc1 (assuming [[!tails_ticket 17376]] is done
  by then: kibi is the RM, anonym is around to help if needed as it's
  the first RC that kibi releases)

  - Switch to overlayfs ([[!tails_ticket 8415]])
  - If [[!tails_ticket 15806 desc="GRUB"]] and [[!tails_ticket 6560 desc="Secure Boot"]]
    are ready to ship as well:
    - Awesome! Otherwise, we'll need another major release by the end of July.
    - Extra manual tests: EFI 64-bit upgrades from syslinux to GRUB
  - Automatic upgrade from 4.2 and newer, all of them with overlayfs-based diff.
    No planned divergence wrt. the documented release process in this respect.
