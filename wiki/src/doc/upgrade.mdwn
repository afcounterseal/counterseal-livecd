[[!meta title="Upgrading a Tails USB stick"]]

Tails includes an automatic mechanism to upgrade a USB stick to
a newer version. In some cases, it is impossible to do an **automatic upgrade**
and you might have to do a **manual upgrade**. This page describes both techniques.

<div class="note">

<p>Your Persistent Storage will be preserved by both automatic and
manual upgrades.</p>

</div>

If you use Tails from a DVD, you need to [[burn a new DVD|install/dvd]].

Checking which version of Tails you are currently running
=========================================================

To check which version of Tails you are currently running, choose
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">Tails</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">About Tails</span></span>.

<a name="automatic"></a>

Automatic upgrade using <span class="application">Tails Upgrader</span>
=======================================================================

After starting Tails and connecting to Tor, <span class="application">Tails
Upgrader</span> automatically checks if upgrades are available and then
proposes you to upgrade your USB stick. The upgrades are checked for and downloaded
through Tor.

The advantages of this technique are the following:

  - You only need a single Tails USB stick. The upgrade is done on the fly from a
    running Tails. After upgrading, you can restart and use the new version.
  - The upgrade is much smaller to download than a full USB image.
  - The upgrade mechanism includes cryptographic verification of the upgrade.
    You don't have to verify the USB image yourself anymore.

Requirements:

  - A Tails USB stick.
  - An Internet connection.

After connecting to Tor, if an upgrade is available, a dialog appears and
proposes you to upgrade your USB stick.

If you decide to do the upgrade, click on <span
class="guilabel">Upgrade now</span>,
and follow the assistant through the upgrade process.

<div class="tip">

<p>If you cannot upgrade at startup (for example, if you have no network
connection by then), you can start <span class="application">Tails
Upgrader</span> later by opening a terminal and executing the following
command:</p>

<pre>tails-upgrade-frontend-wrapper</pre>

</div>

Troubleshooting
---------------

If an error occurs during the upgrade, the assistant proposes you to read one of the following
pages:

  - If an error occurs while checking for available upgrades:<br/>
    [[file:///usr/share/doc/tails/website/doc/upgrade/error/check.en.html|upgrade/error/check]]
  - If an error occurs while download the upgrade:<br/>
    [[file:///usr/share/doc/tails/website/doc/upgrade/error/download.en.html|upgrade/error/download]]
  - If an error occurs while installing the upgrade:<br/>
    [[file:///usr/share/doc/tails/website/doc/upgrade/error/install.en.html|upgrade/error/install]]

If your Tails USB stick fails to start after an automatic upgrade, see
below how to do a manual upgrade.

<a name="manual"></a>

Manual upgrade using <span class="application">Tails Installer</span>
=====================================================================

It might not always be possible to do an automatic upgrade as described above.
For example, when:

  - No automatic upgrade is available from our website for this version.
  - The automatic upgrade is impossible for technical reasons (not enough
    memory, not enough free space on the USB stick, etc.).
  - The automatic upgrade failed and you need to repair a Tails USB stick.
  - You want to upgrade by cloning from another Tails USB stick which is
    already up-to-date, for example, when working offline or with a slow
    Internet connection.

After connecting to Tor, a dialog informs you if you have to
upgrade your USB stick using <span class="application">Tails Installer</span>
to a newer version of Tails.

[[!img upgrader_manual.png link=no]]

To do a manual upgrade, you can either:

- [[Download and upgrade|doc/upgrade/#download]] (below)
- [[Upgrade by cloning from another Tails|doc/upgrade/#clone]] (below)
- [[Burn a new Tails DVD|install/dvd-download]]
- [[Upgrade your virtual machine|install/vm-download]]

<a id="download"></a>

### Download and upgrade

You need:

- Your Tails USB stick
- Another empty USB stick <small>(at least 8 GB)</small>&nbsp;[[!toggle id="why_extra" text="Why?"]]
- 1 hour to download Tails (<small class="remove-extra-space">[[!inline pages="inc/stable_amd64_iso_size" raw="yes" sort="age"]]</small>)
- ½ hour to upgrade

[[!toggleable id="why_extra" text="""
[[!toggle id="why_extra" text="X"]]
[[!inline pages="install/inc/router/why_extra.inline" raw="yes" sort="age"]]
"""]]

See our instructions on how to do a manual upgrade by:

- [[Downloading and upgrading from your Tails|upgrade/tails-overview]] (more secure)
- [[Downloading and upgrading from Windows|upgrade/win-overview]] (more convenient)
- [[Downloading and upgrading from macOS|upgrade/mac-overview]] (more convenient)
- [[Downloading and upgrading from Linux|upgrade/linux-overview]] (more convenient)

<div class="caution">

<p>Downloading and upgrading from Windows might be less secure if your
Windows is compromised but it might be more convenient and faster to
download.</p>

</div>

<a id="clone"></a>

### Upgrade by cloning from another Tails

If you know someone you trust who already did the upgrade, you can
upgrade your Tails by cloning from their Tails.

You need:

- Your Tails USB stick
- Another up-to-date Tails (USB stick or DVD)
- ¼ hour to upgrade

See our instructions on how to do a manual upgrade by:

- [[Cloning from another Tails|upgrade/clone-overview]]
