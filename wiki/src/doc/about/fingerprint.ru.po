"A Tails system is **almost exclusively generating Tor activity** on the "
"network. Usually users of <span class=\"application\">Tor Browser</span> on "
"other operating systems also have network activity outside of Tor, either "
"from another web browser or other applications. So the proportion of Tor "
"activity could be used to determine whether a user of <span class="
"\"application\">Tor Browser</span> is using Tails or not. If you are sharing "
"your Internet connection with other users that are not using Tails it is "
"probably harder for your ISP to determine whether a single user is "
"generating only Tor traffic and so maybe using Tails."

"Tails **does not use the entry guards mechanism of Tor**. With the [entry "
"guard mechanism](https://support.torproject.org/tbb/tbb-2/), a Tor user "
"always uses the same few relays as first hops. As Tails does not store any "
"Tor information between separate working sessions, it does not store the "
"entry guards information either. This behaviour could be used to distinguish "
"Tails users across several working sessions."

"When starting, Tails synchronizes the system clock to make sure it is "

"starts."
