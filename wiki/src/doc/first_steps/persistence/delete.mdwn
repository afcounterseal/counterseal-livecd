[[!meta title="Delete the persistent volume"]]

<div class="caution">

<p>This technique is fast but might not prevent a strong attacker from
recovering files from the old persistent volume using advanced [[data
recovery techniques|encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion#why]].</p>

<p>To securely delete the persistent volume, you have to [[securely
delete the entire USB stick|encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion#erase-device]],
which is a much slower operation.</p>
