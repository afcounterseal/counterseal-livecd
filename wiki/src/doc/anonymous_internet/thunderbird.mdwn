OpenPGP encryption with Enigmail
================================

<span class="application">Thunderbird</span> in Tails includes the
<span class="application">[Enigmail](https://www.enigmail.net/)</span>
extension to encrypt and authenticate emails using OpenPGP.

To configure <span class="application">Enigmail</span> for your email account, you can start the
<span class="application">Enigmail Setup Wizard</span> by choosing
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">[[!img lib/open-menu.png alt="Menu" class=symbolic link=no]]</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">Enigmail</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Setup Wizard</span></span>.

You can also create an OpenPGP key associated with your email address as
part of the <span class="application">Enigmail Setup Wizard</span>.

If you are new to OpenPGP, you can read the following guides on getting
started with encrypting emails using
<span class="application">Thunderbird</span> and
<span class="application">Enigmail</span>:

  - [Security-in-a-Box: Thunderbird & OpenPGP - secure email](https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/thunderbird/linux/)
  - [Enigmail: Enigmail Quick Start Guide](https://www.enigmail.net/index.php/en/user-manual/quick-start)

<div class="caution">

<p>If you have GnuPG keys stored in your Persistent Storage since before Tails 4.1
(December 2019), you should [[update your OpenPGP keyserver
configuration|doc/encryption_and_privacy/openpgp_keyserver]] to use safe
keyservers.</p>

Enhanced privacy
================

<span class="application">Thunderbird</span> in Tails is configured
for additional privacy and anonymity.

For example, <span class="application">Thunderbird</span> in Tails:

- Removes information about the language of your session or spellchecker
  from the headers of the emails that you send.
- Removes information that could identify you as a Tails user, like the
  version of GnuPG or Enigmail, from the headers of the emails that you
  send.
- Only allows secure protocols and disables insecure protocols, like
  SSL3.
- Disables tracking technologies, like cookies and JavaScript, when
  viewing emails or feeds in HTML.

<div class="note">

<p>Emails and feeds in HTML format are displayed in plain text by
default and can become harder to read.</p>

</div>

These enhancements are inherited
from the former
<span class="application">[TorBirdy](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy)</span>
extension.
To learn more about the security properties provided by this configuration,
you can read the [<span class="application">TorBirdy</span> design document](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/raw-attachment/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/EMail/Thunderbird/Thunderbird%2BTor.pdf).

Using Thunderbird in your language
==================================

To use <span class="application">Thunderbird</span> in your language, you can
install the <span class="command">thunderbird-l10n-<span class="command-placeholder">lang</span></span>
package using the [[Additional Software|doc/first_steps/additional_software]]
feature. Replace <span class="command-placeholder">lang</span> with the code
for your language. For example, <span class="command">es</span> for Spanish or
<span class="command">de</span> for German.
