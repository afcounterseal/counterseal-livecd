If your Wi-Fi interface is not working, either:

* There is no Wi-Fi option in the system menu:

  [[!img system-without-wi-fi.png link="no" alt=""]]

* The interface is disabled when starting Tails or when plugging in your USB
  Wi-Fi adapter:

  [[!img mac-spoofing-disabled.png link="no" alt="Notification about network card being disabled"]]

  In this case, you can disable MAC spoofing to get your Wi-Fi interface
  to work in Tails. Disabling MAC spoofing has security implications, so read
  carefully our [[documentation about MAC
  spoofing|first_steps/welcome_screen/mac_spoofing]] before doing so.

To connect to the Internet, you can try to either:

* Use an Ethernet cable instead of Wi-Fi if possible. Wired interfaces work
  much more reliably than Wi-Fi in Tails.
