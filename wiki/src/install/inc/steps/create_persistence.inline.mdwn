<h2 id="wi-fi">Test your Wi-Fi</h2>

Problems with Wi-Fi are unfortunately quite common in Tails and Linux in
general. To test if your Wi-Fi interface works in Tails:

1. Open the system menu in the top-right corner:

   [[!img doc/first_steps/introduction_to_gnome_and_the_tails_desktop/system.png link="no"]]

1. Choose <span class="guilabel">Wi-Fi Not Connected</span> and then
   <span class="guilabel">Select Network</span>.

1. After establishing a connection to a network:

   - If you can already access the Internet, Tor is automatically started.

   - If you need to log in to a captive portal before being granted access to
     the Internet, see our documentation about [[logging in to captive portals|doc/anonymous_internet/unsafe_browser]].

<p>Yay, you managed to start <span class="install-clone mac-clone">your new</span> Tails on your computer!</p>

<p>If you want to save some of your documents

<h1 id="create-persistence">Create a Persistent Storage (optional)</h1>

<div class="step-image">[[!img install/inc/infography/create-persistence.png link="no" alt=""]]</div>

You can optionally create an encrypted Persistent Storage in the
remaining free space on your
<span class="clone">new</span>
Tails USB stick to store any of the following:

  - Personal files
  - Some settings
  - Additional software
  - Encryption keys

The data in the Persistent Storage:

  - Remains available across separate working sessions.
  - Is encrypted using a passphrase of your choice.

<div class="caution">

<p>The Persistent Storage is not hidden. An attacker in possession of
your USB stick can know that there is a Persistent Storage on it. Take into consideration
that you can be forced or tricked to give out its passphrase.</p>

</div>

<div class="caution">

<p>It is possible to
unlock the Persistent Storage from other operating systems. But, doing
so might compromise the security provided by Tails.</p>

<p>For example, image thumbnails might be created and saved by the other operating
system. Or, the contents of files might be indexed by the other operating
system.</p>

<p>Other operating systems should probably not be trusted to handle
sensitive information or leave no trace.</p>

</div>

Create the Persistent Storage
-----------------------------

1. Choose
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guisubmenu">Tails</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Configure persistent volume</span></span>.

1. Specify a passphrase of your choice in both the
<span class="guilabel">Passphrase</span> and <span class="guilabel">Verify
Passphrase</span> text boxes.

   <div class="tip">
   <p>We recommend choosing a long passphrase made of five to seven random words.
   <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/03/26/passphrases-can-memorize-attackers-cant-guess/">Learn more.</a></p>
   </div>

1. Click on the <span class="guilabel">Create</span> button.

2. Wait for the creation to finish.

3. The list of features of the Persistent Storage appears. Each
   feature corresponds to a set of files or settings that can be saved in the
   Persistent Storage.

   We recommend you to only turn on the Personal
   Data feature for the time being. You
   can turn on more features later on according to your needs.

4. Click <span class="button">Save</span>.

   <div class="step-image">[[!img install/inc/infography/restart-on-tails.png link="no" alt=""]]</div>

Restart and unlock the Persistent Storage
-----------------------------------------

1. Shut down the computer and restart on your
   <span class="clone">new</span>
   Tails USB stick.

1. In the Welcome Screen:

   [[!img install/inc/screenshots/welcome_screen_with_persistence.png link="no" alt="Welcome to Tails!"]]

   - Select your language and keyboard layout in the
     <span class="guilabel">Language & Region</span> section.

   - In the **Encrypted Persistent Storage** section,
     enter your passphrase and click **Unlock** to unlock the
     Persistent Storage for the current working session.

   - Click <span class="button">Start Tails</span>.

1. After 15&ndash;30 seconds, the Tails desktop appears.

1. You can now save your personal files and working documents in the
<span class="guilabel">Persistent</span> folder. To open the
<span class="guilabel">Persistent</span> folder choose
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Places</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Persistent</span></span>.
